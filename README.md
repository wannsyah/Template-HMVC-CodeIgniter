# Template-HMVC-Codeigniter
This extension for CodeIgniter enables the use of the Hierarchical Model View Controller(HMVC) pattern and makes your application modular. This allows easy distribution of independent components (MVC) in a single directory across other CodeIgniter applications. All modules are grouped in their own folder and can have their own controller, model, view, library, config, helper and language files.
